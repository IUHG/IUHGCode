decompose will generate data for all time steps included in the range 
specified in hydroparam.h.You can then use torquemode.pro to plot whatever 
range you are interested. Generally it's a good idea to run decompose 
over the entire asymtotic phase and then go back and plot what you're 
interested in. torquecombined.pro plots data from more than one run for 
comparison purposes. The .pro files can be found in the IDL folder. Other
things to watch for are making sure that the data path and output path
are set correctly and the the endian is set properly in the Makefile. 
There are several makefiles included, to use a different compiler copy 
the one you'd like to use to Makefile. Jobs can be submitted using the 
dcomp.sub script which is valid for the PBS scheduler.
