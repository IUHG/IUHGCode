decompose will generate data for all time steps included in the range 
specified in dcomp.f. You can then use torquemode.pro to plot whatever 
range you are interested. Generally it's a good idea to run decompose 
over the entire asymtotic phase and then go back and plot what you're 
interested in. torquecombined.pro plots data from more than one run for 
comparison purposes.
